## 🎯 Overview

This project renders various types of fractals including:
- Mandelbrot Set
- Julia Set
- Tricorn (Mandelbar) Set

Created as part of the 42 core curriculum, this program focuses on using a low-level graphic library and visualization of fractals.

# Reboot is required after XQuartz installation
```

Dependencies:
- MinilibX graphics library (included in project)
- Math library
- C compiler (cc)
- Make

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hermeszi/fractol.git
cd fractol
```

2. Compile the program:
```bash
make
```

## 🚀 Usage

```
*--------------42 Fractol---------------*
* Usage: ./fractol [-m | -j | -t]      *
* Examples:                             *
*   Mandelbrot: ./fractol -m           *
*   Julia Set : ./fractol -j 0.4 0.6   *
*---------------------------------------*
```

### Available Options:
- `-m`: Generate Mandelbrot set
- `-j`: Generate Julia set (requires real and imaginary parameters)
- `-t`: Generate Tricorn set

### Examples:
```bash
# Generate Mandelbrot set
./fractol -m

# Generate Julia set with specific parameters
./fractol -j 0.4 0.6

# Generate Tricorn set
./fractol -t
```

## 📈 Ongoing Development

Planned enhancements include:
- Additional fractal types
- More color schemes
- Performance optimizations
